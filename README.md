# gba-lz77

A GBA-compatible implementation of LZ77 compression/decompression.

The compressor will produce byte-identical results to whatever was used on LEGO Island 2 (GBA, 2001), and presumably other GBA games too.

Each tool takes two commandline arguments: the input file path followed by the output file path.
